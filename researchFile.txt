create a website that will be hosted on github pages. It is for a graphics engineer. The aim is for it to be a visual resume eventually displaying graphics and AI projects.

1. Use html, css, javascript.
2. Prevent most hacking exploits on the site, including cross-site scripting.
3. Have a table across the top with
    a. Home
    b. graphics
    c. ML/AI
4. the whole thing should be on one page.
5. the button in the header tab, should skip navigation down to the appropriate section.

For the home page:
Add an animation background with snowfall particles cascading down. Particles should start falling from a location uniformly spread across the top of the browser.

the graphics and ML/AI sections mutually should:
1. List different projects in tables that contain:
    a. a thumbnail to show quick picture for what the project is about
    b. the title of the project
    c. a quick abstract about the project

Extra notes on implementation:

1. Navigation Bar (Fixed Header)

Home | Graphics | ML/AI | Contact
Glassmorphism effect with blur backdrop
Animated underline on hover
Smooth scroll to sections

2. Home Section

Large gradient title: "Graphics Engineer"
Subtitle describing specializations
Full-viewport hero layout
Snowfall particle animation background

3. Graphics Projects Section

## example project card

4. ML/AI Projects Section

## example project card

5. Contact Section (NEW)

Invitation text for collaboration
Social links with icons:

GitHub
LinkedIn
Twitter/X
Shadertoy (great for graphics engineers!)



6. Footer
